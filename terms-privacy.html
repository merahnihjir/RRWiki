            <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>

        <p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the <a target="_blank" href="https://rumbleroyale.net">rumbleroyale.net</a> website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services.</p>

        <p>Although the Website and Services may link to other resources (such as websites, mobile applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you access through a link on the Website. Your linking to any other off-site resources is at your own risk.</p>
        <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its terms related to the Website and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page, post a notification on the main page of the Website. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.</p>
        <p>An updated version of this Agreement will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Agreement unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Agreement (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.</p>
        <h2>Acceptance of these terms</h2>
        <p>You acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Website and Services you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Agreement, you are not authorized to access or use the Website and Services. This terms and conditions policy was created with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.websitepolicies.com">WebsitePolicies</a>.</p>
        <h2>Contacting us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this Agreement, we encourage you to contact us on the page below:</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="contact-us.html">Contact Us</a></p>



            <h1>Privacy Policy:</h1>
            

            <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy.  We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the personal information we collect from users of our website and our online services.</p>
            <h2>We collect personal information from users, as described below:</h2>
            <h2>Information You Provide to Us. </h2>
            

            
            
            <p>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.</p>
            
            
            <p>If you sign up for our newsletter we will collect your email address.</p>
            <p>If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or giveaway on our Site, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not).  We may also ask for you first and last name, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity.  In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice.  These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary.  We recommend that you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.</p>
            <p>We may also collect personal information, such as at other points in our Service that state that personal information is being collected.</p>
            
            <p>Information Collected from Twitch and other Social Networking Sites.  Our Services may enable users to register for an account using their Twitch login credentials, Twitter login credentials, Gmail login credentials, or other third party social networking service (“SNS”) supported by us.  If you are not a registered user of the Services and you click “Sign In” using Twitch or another SNS that we support, you will first be asked to enter your Twitch or SNS credentials and then be given the option to register for the Services.  In this case, we may receive information from Twitch or another SNS to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Site.  Any information that we collect from Twitch or other SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with Twitch or that SNS, so please consult the relevant SNS’s privacy and data practices.</p>
            <h2>Information Collected via Technology</h2>
            
            <p>Log Files.  As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.  Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.</p>
            <p>Cookies.  Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.  “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Service.  This type of information is collected to make the Service more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.</p>
            <p>Pixel Tags. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).  Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users.  In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages.  Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.  We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.  We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ personal information.</p>
            <p>Traffic Analytics.  We use a number of third party service providers, such as Google Analytics, to help analyze how users use the Service (“Analytics Companies”).  These Analytics Companies uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Service, what features they use on our Site, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from these Analytics Companies only to improve our Site and Services. These Analytics Companies collect only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Service, rather than your name or other personally identifying information.  We do not combine the information generated through the use of our Analytics Companies with your personal information. Although these Analytics Companies may plant a persistent Cookie on your web browser or mobile device to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but the Analytics Company that placed the applicable Cookie.  This Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for the Cookies used by these Analytics Companies.</p>
            

            <h2>Use of Your Personal information</h2>
            <p>General Use.  In general, personal information you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. We use your personal information in the following ways:
            
            <p>provide the Services you request, including our loyalty programs;</p>
            <p>improve the quality of experience when you interact with our Site and Services;</p>
            
            <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal information.</h2>
            <p>We disclose your personal information as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Third Party Service Providers.  We may share your personal information with third party service providers to: provide you with the Services that we offer through our Site; conduct quality assurance testing; provide technical support; and/or provide other services to Rumble Royale.
            <p>You are solely and completely responsible for those policies, agreements, and settings. We are not responsible for your agreement with, or the actions taken by, such Third Party. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Services to improve the Services we provide to you.</p>
            </p>
            <p>Other Disclosures. Regardless of any choices you make regarding your personal information (as described below), Rumble Royale may disclose personal information if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) in connection with any legal investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Rumble Royale; (c) to protect or defend the rights or property of Rumble Royale or users of the Site or Services; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our Terms of Use.</p>
            <h2>Personal data retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide you with our Services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. If you have an account with us, we will typically retain your Personal Data for a period of 90 days after you have requested that your account is closed or if it’s been inactive for 7 years.</p>
            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                
        <p>This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and we may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. If you have questions and/or require more information, do not hesitate to contact us on Discord <a href="https://discord.gg/rumbleroyale">https://discord.gg/rumbleroyale</a></p>
