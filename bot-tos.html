            <h1>Terms of Service:</h1>
            <p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the Rumble Royale application (“Application” or “bot”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Application operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Application and Services. By accessing and using the Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Application and Services.</p>

            <h2>By using the Application, you agree that:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>You will not violate this Agreement, the Discord Terms of Service (https://discord.com/terms) nor the Discord Guidelines (https://discord.com/guidelines) while using the Application.
            <li>You will not use the bot for any illegal and/or malicious behaviour.
            <li>You will not attempt to purposely interrupt the operation of the Application.
            <li>You will not abuse or benefit of exploits of bugs of or related to the Bot.
            <li>You will not use macros, scripts, auto-clickers or any other form of automation to interact with the Application.
            <li>Your use of the Application is purely for virtual entertainment. We are not responsible for any real-life damages caused by your use of the Application.
            <li>We reserve the right to revoke temporarily or permanently your access to the Application at any time for any reason, with or without prior notice.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although the Application and Services may link to other resources (such as websites, mobile applications, servers etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you access through a link on our Services.</p>
            
            <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its terms related to the Application and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.</p>
            
            <p>An updated version of this Agreement will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Agreement unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Application  and Services after the effective date of the revised Agreement (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.</p>
            <h2>Acceptance of these terms</h2>
            <p>You acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Bot and Services you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Agreement, you are not authorized to access or use the Application and Services. This terms and conditions policy was created with the help of WebsitePolicies.</p>
